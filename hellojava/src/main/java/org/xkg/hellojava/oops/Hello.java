/*
* Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that consider programs as the collection of objects and data and
* provides many concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism,encapsulation,class and object.
*
* Class is a data structure that contains data and functions bundled together under a unit.It is a blueprint of specific object.
* Class doesn't consume any space.
*
* Object is instance of class ,a runtime entity and it has its own state, behavior and identity.
*
* Binding method and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.A java class is the example of encapsulation.
*
* Hiding internal details and showing only essential method  is known as abstraction.
* It helps to reduce the complexity and also improves the maintainability of the system.
* In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
*
* Inheritance means to use something that already made.It is used in java for achieve concept of code reusability.
*
* Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for multiple forms.
* In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
